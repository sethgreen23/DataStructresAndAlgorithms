public class Main {
/*
	The LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to implement the List interface. In addition
	to the 25 methods specified by the Collection and List interfaces, this class also implements
	these 11 other methods:
	void addFirst(E o)
	void addLast(E o)
	E element()
	E getFirst()
	E getLast()
	boolean offer(E o)
	E peek()
	E poll()
	E remove()
	E removeFirst()
	E removeLast()
	The add, get, and remove methods that refer to first and last access the first element and
	last element of the list, respectively. For example, the call
	list.addFirst(x);
	would add the object x to the front of the list, making it the first element.
	Note that the three remove methods listed here are all obviated by the remove(int) method
	specified by the List interface. The LinkedList methods remove() and removeFirst() are
	the same as the List method remove(0).
	The other five new methods (element(), offer(), peek(), poll(), and remove()) are
	outlined below.
