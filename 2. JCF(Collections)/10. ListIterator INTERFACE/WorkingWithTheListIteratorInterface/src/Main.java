public class Main {
/*
	The ListIterator interface extends the Iterator interface by specifying the six additional
	methods shown in Figure 4.9. These extra methods require ListIterator objects to be bidirectional. Thus, previous(), hasPrevious(), and previousIndex() act the same way as
	next(), hasNext(),and nextIndex(), respectively, except in the reverse direction.
	The ListIterator interface also adds two more “optional requirements”: the add() and
	set() methods, to accompany the optional remove() method. Recall (page 72) that the purpose
	of specifying an “optional” method in an interface is to recommend the method signature for that
	method if it is implemented. To avoid implementing the method, the class can simply throw a
	new UnsupportedOperationException object, as shown on page 72.
