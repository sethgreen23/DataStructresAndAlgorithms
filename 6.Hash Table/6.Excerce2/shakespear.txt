Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The good is oft interred after them,
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, --
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men.
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
he was my friend, faithful and just to me.
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this is Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Coesar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is and honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him with a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But there I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause.
What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
O judgement! thou art feld to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason!
